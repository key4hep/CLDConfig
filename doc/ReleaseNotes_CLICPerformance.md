      - Set the number of minimum hits on a track to 3 after the fit to recover efficiency loss seen in the case of single isolated muons. Previously this was set to 4 to reduce the number of fakes in the complex events which is still acceptable using a threshold at 3 hits.

  - fccReconstruction: in ConformalTracking settings, added processor parameter to enable/disable the tight cuts for the combined vertex barrel + endcap reconstruction 
  - default = true (enabled)
  - for FCCee, it needs to be disabled because of 10degrees tracks (2 hits in the vertex barrel + 6 in the endcap). Looser cuts allow to pick the vertex (b+e) hits in one track, otherwise tight cuts allow for a track made with a subset of hits, while the leftover hits are used for a second track
  - the external processor parameter is a temporary solution

    * cleanup header files, drop registration with eventseeder
    * wrap relations in shared_ptr to clean them automatically

* 2017-06-28 Andre Sailer ([PR#25](https://github.com/ilcsoft/CLICPerformance/pull/25))
  - ReconstructionSteering: remove duplicate setting of DebugPlots for ConformalTracking

* 2017-06-30 Andre Sailer ([PR#26](https://github.com/ilcsoft/CLICPerformance/pull/26))
  - Ensure that histograms and trees are written only to their folder in the RootFile. AIDAProcessor already writes the outputs so we don't have to as well
  - TrackChecker: beautify fit output by naming parameters. Fix issue with unnormalised gauss function

* 2017-07-05 Andre Sailer ([PR#27](https://github.com/ilcsoft/CLICPerformance/pull/27))
  - Add suppressions for root things, lcio buffers etc.

* 2017-07-10 Andre Sailer ([PR#28](https://github.com/ilcsoft/CLICPerformance/pull/28))
  - Add suppressions for 4-8 byte definite leaks in root compiled with llvm39
  - Add suppressions for more still reachable leaks in root (based on gcc)

* 2017-07-11 Andre Sailer ([PR#29](https://github.com/ilcsoft/CLICPerformance/pull/29))
  - Reconstruction: Add REC/DST OutputProcessors
  - Reconstruction: Change default name of the output file to Output_REC.slcio and Output_DST.slcio instead of sitracks.slcio
  - Reconstruction: Change name of `SelectedPandoraPFO` collections. Instead of `SelectedPandoraPFANewPFO` collections

* 2017-07-11 Andre Sailer ([PR#30](https://github.com/ilcsoft/CLICPerformance/pull/30))
  - Add LumiCalReco processor
  - Add BeamCalReco processor

* 2017-07-11 Daniel Hynds ([PR#31](https://github.com/ilcsoft/CLICPerformance/pull/31))
  - updated chi2 for conformal tracking to account for new track fit
  - removed tracker hit collections from steering file. If included, the conformal tracking will extend tracks through them and the extrapolator should not be used. Still under testing

# v01-00
*  General: At present the package contains only processors for the Tracking systems. Further dedicated folders for Calorimetry performance etc. should be added in future. The configuration folder contains steering files for the reconstruction in Marlin, and a test script (testClicBuild.sh) which allows a fast check of new relseases/geometries etc.
*  ClicEfficiencyCalculator: Processor to calculate the tracking efficiency. Only the input hit collections are considered, allowing the efficiency to be restricted to the given subdetectors.
*  TrackChecker: Processor to evaluate the pull and residual distributions of the track fitting.
